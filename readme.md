# C# Discord Response Bot: Vibe Coded Edition ðŸš€

Welcome to the epicenter of **vibe coding**! This project embodies a streamlined, AI-assisted approach to creating a simple yet powerful Discord bot using C# and .NET, powered by the intuitive Discord.Net library. Forget complex configurations; we're all about that **flow state development**. This bot listens for specific messages from predefined users and delivers hyper-personalized, configured responses, achieving true **human-bot synergy**.

Leveraging **cloud-native** principles with Docker support and a cutting-edge GitHub Actions workflow for **hyper-automation**, this setup allows you to focus purely on the creative **vibe** of crafting interactions, not the operational overhead.

## Core Vibes & Features

* **Intuitive Responses:** Reacts dynamically to specific trigger messages from designated users.
* **Agile Configuration:** Managed via `appsettings.json` for seamless, **low-code** updates to users, triggers, and responses. Just tweak the JSON and let the vibe flow!
* **Discord.Net Synergy:** Utilizes the powerful Discord.Net library for seamless API interaction.
* **Containerized Deployment:** Includes a `Dockerfile` for effortless, **cloud-native** deployment.
* **Hyper-Automated CI/CD:** Features a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`) for a fully automated build and push pipeline to GHCR â€“ pure **DevOps synergy**!
* **Intelligent Logging:** Structured logging via Microsoft.Extensions.Logging for enhanced observability.

## Foundational Tech Stack

* [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (Version specified in `YourProjectName.csproj`, e.g., .NET 8.0) - The bedrock of our C# vibe.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) - For containerizing the vibe (essential for cloud-native deployment).
* A Discord Bot Token (See [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)) - Your key to the Discord dimension.
* Git - For **collaborative vibe synchronization** (version control).
* A GitHub Account - The platform for our **automated workflow magic** (Actions and GHCR).
